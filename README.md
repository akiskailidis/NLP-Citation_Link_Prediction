# NLP-Citation_Link_Prediction
Build a model to predict whether a paper cites another paper.

Overview
In this challenge, you will deal with the problem of predicting whether a research paper cites another research paper. You are given a citation network consisting of several thousands of research papers, along with their abstracts and their list of authors. The pipeline that is typically followed to deal with the problem is similar to the one applied in any classification problem; to use edge information to learn the parameters of a classifier and then to use the classifier to predict whether two nodes are linked by an edge or not.

Description
Link prediction is the problem of predicting the existence of a link between two entities in a network.

The problem of link prediction has recently attracted a lot of attention in many domains. For instance, in social networks, one may be interested in predicting friendship links among users, while in biology, predicting interactions between genes and proteins is of paramount importance.

In this challenge, your task is to predict whether one research paper cites another based on a citation network of several thousand papers. Each paper comes with an abstract, a list of authors, and information about which papers it currently cites. By analyzing patterns within this citation data, you aim to build a model that forecasts the existence of a link (i.e., a citation) between two papers that do not already have one. This type of link prediction has significant implications not only in bibliometrics and recommendation systems for academic papers, but also in social networks and biology, where similar predictive tasks are vital for uncovering hidden relationships.

The approach to this problem follows a familiar supervised learning pipeline: first, you extract features that capture the nature of connections between two papersâ€”this could include textual similarity of abstracts, overlap or relatedness of authors, as well as network-based metrics (e.g., common neighbors or shortest path distance in the citation graph). After creating these feature vectors for paper pairs, you train a classifier on known citation links (positive examples) and known non-links (negative examples). Finally, you use this trained model to infer whether a new pair of papers is likely to be linked by a citation or not, effectively predicting future or currently undiscovered citations. By leveraging network structure, document content, and authorship information, you can develop increasingly accurate models to tackle one of the most intriguing challenges in large-scale graph analysis.
